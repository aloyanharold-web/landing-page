## Note

Due to GitHub API limitations with binary files, these image files need to be uploaded manually through the GitHub web interface or using git commands locally.

To upload the images:
1. Clone the repository locally
2. Copy the image files to this `images/` directory
3. Commit and push the changes

Alternatively, you can drag and drop the image files directly into this directory using the GitHub web interface.
